# Bio
Hi, my name is Johan Reitsma. I am a Lead Developer at TRES in the Netherlands. 
I am a Umbraco Certified Master and a big fan of Umbraco since 2013 and a .NET developer since 2005.

I've been working with Umbraco since 2014. I have had a chance to work with various versions of Umbraco (v7, v8, and v10). 
My love for Umbraco is huge because of the community and because of the power to build great websites or applications using Umbraco.

After work, I spent a lot of time on my little girl and girlfriend and occasionally some time with my classic car (Opel Manta (Type B1)) and Lego .
I constantly learn more about Umbraco by following MVPs and reading   blogs on Medium, Skrift, 24Days, and others blogs.
